	abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology makes it possible to supply power through an air-gap, without the need for current-carrying wires. One important technique of WPT technology is magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) WPT. Based on the advantages of MRC WPT, such as safety and high power transfer efficiency over a long transmit distance, there are many possible applications of MRC WPT. This study provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the MRC WPT technology and wireless charging for electric vehicle (EV). A comparative overview of MRC WPT system design which includes a detailed description of the prototypes, schematics, compensation circuit topologies (impedance matching), and international charging standards. In addition, this study provides an overview of wireless EV charging including the static wireless EV charging and the dynamic wireless EV charging, which focuses on the coil design, power transfer efficiency, and current research achievement in the literature.},

	abstract = {The power electronic subsystems within electric vehicle (EV) powertrains are required to manage both the energy flows within the vehicle and the delivery of torque by the electrical machine. Such systems are known to generate undesired electrical noise on the high voltage bus. High frequency current oscillations, or ripple, if unhindered will enter the vehicle’s battery system. Real-world measurements of the current on the high voltage bus of a series hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) show that significant current perturbations ranging from 10Hz to in excess of 10kHz are present. Little is reported within the academic literature about the potential impact on battery system performance and the rate of degradation associated with exposing the battery to coupled direct current (DC) and alternating currents (AC). This paper documents an experimental investigation that studies the long-term impact of current ripple on battery performance degradation. Initial results highlight that both capacity fade and impedance rise progressively increase as the frequency of the superimposed AC current increases. A further conclusion is that the spread of degradation for cells cycled with a coupled AC–DC signal is considerably more than for cells exercised with a traditional DC waveform. The underlying causality for this degradation is not yet understood. However, this has important implications for the battery management system (BMS). Increased variations in cell capacity and impedance will cause differential current flows and heat generation within the battery pack that if not properly managed will further reduce battery life and degrade the operation of the vehicle.}
